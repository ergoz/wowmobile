#summary How to control the WoW Mobile client.

= Keyboard =

This is the primary way of controlling WoW Mobile.

There is a key designated as a shift, currently that is the Delete (Backspace) key. This acts as a modifier. After one press it will "stick" - a blue background S will indicate the shift is active.

 * Use the arrows and Execute / Enter key
 * Key 0 opens the menu
 * Keys 1-9 jump directly to the displayed action
 * Shift {{{*}}} toggles detail view
 * Shift # toggles debugging info

= Touch screen =

The interface for keyless devices is lacking a lot. The on-screen keyboard provides most of the interaction.

 * Tapping in the player screen selects monsters / players.
 * Tapping the minimap in the player screen show the map.
 * Dragging the map screen scrolls the map area.
