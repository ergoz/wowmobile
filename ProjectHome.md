The purpose of this project is to create a mobile client for servers emulating the protocol used by World of Warcraft.

Although at this time the amount of media required for a good gaming experience would be overkill it will be possible to use the less demanding parts of the user interface.

Note that this is not a proxy project, the entire client side - including 3D graphics - runs on the mobile device.
